# ChannelMixingDiscretization

[![Build Status](https://github.com/donrolih/ChannelMixingDiscretization.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/donrolih/ChannelMixingDiscretization.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

This is a Julia package for numerical discretization of a general quantum impurity problem (with or with channel mixing)
bath. It is based on an article by [Liu et. al.](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.93.035102).
